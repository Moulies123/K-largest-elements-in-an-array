Find K Largest Elements in an Array

Overview
This Java program finds the k largest elements in an array by using sorting. The approach involves sorting the array in descending order and then selecting the first k elements from the sorted array. This method ensures that we get the k largest elements efficiently, with a time complexity primarily determined by the sorting operation.

Features
Sorts the Array: Utilizes Java's built-in sorting methods to arrange the array elements in descending order.
Extracts K Largest Elements: After sorting, retrieves the top k elements from the sorted array.
Flexible Input: Allows users to specify the size of the array and the value of k.
